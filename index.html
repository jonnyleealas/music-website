        <h2>What is recorded music?</h2>
            <pfont-size:18px;"> Music can be created and enjoyed in a live setting. Recording the music is capturing the sounds, and experience in order to listen to that moment at a later time. Ever listen to the radio? Well, that music had to be recorded so the radio could play that song over and over.
